# smart_office_project

This is the repo for MSc CE dissertation.

### Introduce

The project introduces a method to build a seat occupancy system with a smart IoT office system. It contains three subsystems, which are smart chair system, smart desk occupancy system and smart desktop clock system, to provide desk occupancy monitoring, chair occupancy monitoring, desk check-in and out, and office indoor environmental parameter measurement. A Flutter App is designed for user interaction and data visualisation. 3D print PLA enclosure are used for sensor boxes. The system can be deployed in the office or study space.

### Hardware Components 

+ Seat pressure sensors and Zigbee binary sensors.
+ Infrared motion sensor with ESP8266 NodeMCU module.
+ Integrated desktop clock with Arduino Nano 33 IoT.
